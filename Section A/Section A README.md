### Review Option 1 Python

1. Correctioness
  1. The class implementation does not not have a formal parameter.
  2. An array implemetation should have been used instead of dictionary.
  3. The code from line 3 has an indent error, you must make sure that you follow proper indentation when working with Python, otherwise your code will not work.
  4. After class implementation the recommended indetation for the send statement is 4 spaces.
2. Efficiency.
   1. The code does not produce desired results
3. Style
   1. Meaningful words has been used for variables.
   2. The object obj1 initialize "Solution" in line 1 require a parament but the class implementation does not have one.
4. Documentation
   1. The code has bad documentation.
   2. I can encourage you to comment each section to make it easier to follow your code.
   3. when you write your program try also to explain each function and what it does.
   4. You can use a singleline comment by starting with a hash symbol "#" the interpreter will ignore what comes after the symbol until you start another line.
   5. If you have alot to explain in a comment you must ask start each line with the "#" symbol
